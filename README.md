# VR-steps
## Intro
I created a simple arcade game with simulated data for now or with key control.

The idea is that given pressures from each foot (simulted/key control/live) -> calculate center of gravity -> move character based on it -> earn score by avoiding the falling obstacles.

## Installation
- install ffmpeg and put it in project folder
- create venv:
  - py -3.10 -m venv /.venv
  - .venv\Scripts\activate
  - pip3 install -r requirements.txt

  - To create videos, download ffmpeg and put the folder in this project folder.
